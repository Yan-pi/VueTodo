# VueTodo

VueTodo is a simple Todo list application built with Vue.js and Vite. It allows users to create and manage tasks, categorizing them as "business" or "personal," track their completion status, and edit or delete tasks as needed.

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks by providing a task title and selecting the task type as either "business" or "personal."
- **Task Management:** Users can view all tasks in a list format, sorted by their creation time. Each task displays its title, type, and completion status.
- **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as completed or mark them as incomplete if they are not finished yet.
- **Task Editing:** Users have the ability to edit the title, type, and completion status of tasks.
- **Task Deletion:** Users can delete unwanted tasks from the list.
